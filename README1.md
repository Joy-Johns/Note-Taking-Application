  ## Installation
  npm i

  ## Usage
    To use this application you will need to access the Develop folder. Under the Public folder, you will see an index.html file. In the CLI, change directory into public folder. 
    [cd Cloned\Sarter\Code  ; cd Develop   ; cd public]
    Once you are in the public folder, run node server.js. The CLI will show "App listening on PORT 3001".
    From here, you will open a browser and type into the address field, <localhost:3001>. You can now use the Note Taking Application.
